# Cropland Mapping using Deep Learning and Tabular Data

This project addresses the classification of cropland using geospatial features and deep learning techniques. The model utilizes remote sensing data and tabular attributes to classify cropland areas effectively.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

To run this notebook, install the following packages (some may already be available on Google Colab or Kaggle):

```bash
pip install --upgrade scikit-learn==1.6.1 imbalanced-learn category-encoders numpy==1.26.4 pandas scipy

Other required libraries:

geopandas

# Data Description
The dataset includes geospatial shapefiles and tabular data. Preprocessing steps include:

Loading data with geopandas

Standardizing features

Handling class imbalance with SMOTE

Train-test split with train_test_split

Creating a K-D tree for spatial operations

# Model Architecture
The model is a 1D Convolutional Neural Network built using TensorFlow/Keras. It includes:

Input Layer

Conv1D Layer

Dropout Layers

Dense Layers with ReLU activation

Output Layer with Softmax activation for multi-class classification
